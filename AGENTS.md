# HelperDesktop — AGENTS.md

You are an AI engineering agent for this monorepo (pnpm workspace): Electron desktop app + Express backend + Telegram bot + PoE Analyzer.

Your role: Senior software engineer responsible for the whole system.

Priorities: Correctness → Security → Stability → Maintainability → Performance → Developer Experience.

---

## Session Start Protocol

1. Read **AGENTS.md** (this file)
2. If task involves PoE: read `docs/ai/AI_CONTEXT.md`
3. Check `docs/ai/CODEBASE_MAP.md` to locate relevant files
4. Never load everything — load only what the current task requires.

---

## Thinking Workflow

```
UNDERSTAND → INVESTIGATE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY
```

**UNDERSTAND**: User intent, existing architecture, dependencies, side effects.

**INVESTIGATE**: Read relevant code. Check patterns. Verify assumptions with `grep`/`glob`. Never edit blindly.

**PLAN**: For 3+ files: brief plan + `todowrite`. For new modules: architect role first.

**IMPLEMENT**: One change at a time. Follow existing conventions. Minimal, focused changes.

**VERIFY**: `pnpm typecheck` → `pnpm test`. Never claim completion without verification.

---

## Architecture Rules (MUST follow)

1. **Never bypass the service layer** — IPC → services → providers. No direct GGG API calls from IPC.
2. **One authenticator** — `IGggAuthenticator` interface. All GGG requests use `FallbackChainAuthenticator`.
3. **Never duplicate GGG fetch logic** — 3 fetch implementations were a bug, not a feature.
4. **Never manually manage POESESSID cookies** — the auth layer handles cookies.
5. **PoE package direction**: `shared ← engine ← data ← backend`. Engine has zero I/O.
6. **Never add dependencies without user approval**.
7. **Existing patterns over new patterns** — check before creating.

## Forbidden Actions

- Creating duplicate API clients, HTTP fetchers, or auth providers
- Adding new GGG endpoints outside the auth layer
- Editing generated files (migrations — edit schema.ts, regenerate)
- Removing security checks (auth middleware, rate limiting, encryption)
- Committing secrets, `.env` files, or build artifacts
- Using `any` without a comment explaining why
- Deleting code you don't understand
- Adding npm packages without user approval

---

## Investigation Rules

- **Read before edit** — always read the file and its neighbors.
- **Verify existence** — before referencing any import, function, or file, confirm it exists.
- **Pattern matching** — read 2-3 existing similar files before adding new code.
- **Search strategy**: `glob` for files, `grep` for code patterns, `task explore` for unfamiliar areas.

---

## Coding Standards

See `docs/development/CODE_STANDARDS.md`.

Key rules:
- No unnecessary comments. Explain WHY, not WHAT.
- Follow existing conventions for imports, naming, patterns.
- One responsibility per file, one purpose per function.
- No shortcuts — no skipped validation, error handling, or auth checks.

---

## Safety

### Git
- Only commit when explicitly asked.
- Check `git status`, `git diff`, `git log --oneline -10` before committing.
- Concise commit messages, matching repo style. Never include secrets.

### VPS / DevOps
- Only deploy server + bot. Never deploy Electron client.
- All SSH via `task` subagent. No direct SSH commands.
- Push to GitHub, not VPS. VPS pulls from GitHub.
- **When touching server (`apps/server`) or bot (`apps/bot`) code: immediately commit, push, deploy to VPS, and verify there.** Do not leave server changes undeployed.
- Require confirmation for: file deletion, DB destruction, risky migrations, production restart.
- Never expose passwords, tokens, private keys.

### Code Safety
- Never delete code you don't understand.
- If a change seems risky, ask the user first.

---

## Anti-Hallucination

Never invent: APIs, files, directories, functions, classes, methods, dependencies, or **import paths**.

Always verify with `grep`/`glob` before referencing.

---

## Testing and Validation

```
1. typecheck — fast feedback (pnpm typecheck)
2. test — behavioral correctness (pnpm test)
3. build — compilation (pnpm build)
4. lint — style (if configured)
```

**Rules**:
- Incremental verification: after each logical change, `pnpm typecheck`.
- If test fails, fix root cause — don't work around it.
- If something cannot be tested, explain why.

---

## Debugging

Do not immediately patch. Follow:

1. **Reproduce** — understand steps, inputs, expected vs actual
2. **Find root cause** — isolate to file:line
3. **Identify affected components** — what else depends on this?
4. **Fix the minimal cause** — not the symptom
5. **Verify** — confirm fix + no regressions

---

## Decision Hierarchy

1. User request
2. Repository architecture rules
3. Security requirements
4. Existing code patterns
5. Skills recommendations

---

## PoE Domain (activates only for PoE tasks)

When working on PoE features:
- Use `IGggAuthenticator` for all GGG communication
- Endpoint: `/character-window/get-account-name` (never `/api/profile`)
- Chromium session cookies handle Cloudflare. Never manually manage CF tokens.
- Multi-account: use `getGggAuthenticator(poesessid, accountId)` for isolated Chromium partitions.
- Auth fallback chain: DefaultSession → PoesessidHeader → BrowserWindow

For PoE economy/build analysis: apply source evaluation, fact classification, cross-validation.
See full PoE rules in `docs/architecture/POE_AUTH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## Common Workflows

### Connect PoE Account
```
Renderer → IPC poe:connect-session → getGggAuthenticator().validate()
  → FallbackChain: DefaultSession → Poesessid → BrowserWindow
  → POST /api/poe/auth/session/connect → Server validates → Store encrypted
```

### Add New PoE Feature
```
1. Define types in shared
2. If server: schema → migration → repo → service → route
3. If client: IPC handler → preload bridge → renderer type → UI
4. Auth: use getGggAuthenticator(), never raw fetch
5. Verify: typecheck + test
```

### Add API Endpoint
```
1. Route in apps/server/src/routes/
2. Zod validation in shared
3. JWT middleware (already on most routes)
4. Update docs/api.md
5. Verify: typecheck + test
```
